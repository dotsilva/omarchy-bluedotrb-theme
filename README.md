# Install

```
omarchy-theme-install https://github.com/dotsilva/omarchy-bluedotrb-theme
```

# Featuring

1 to border size and 1 to gaps in, just the minimal to help differentiate the windows! We want every pixel of the screen.

Blue, light blue, light purple, dark gray and light gray color palette.

# Extras

You can install the waybar that is in the preview [here, its the 1.5 version](https://github.com/adsovetzky/Adsovetzky-Omarchy-s-Waybar).

# Thanks
